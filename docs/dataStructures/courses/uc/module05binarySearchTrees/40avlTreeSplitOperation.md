# Split An AvlTree into Two AvlTrees

## Prerequisites

## The Problem Statement

* Split the given `AvlTree` from the node of key `x` in such a way that we get two `AVLTrees` where one `AvlTree` gets all the nodes that are less than or equal to the `x`, and the other `AvlTree` gets all the nodes that are greater than `x`.
