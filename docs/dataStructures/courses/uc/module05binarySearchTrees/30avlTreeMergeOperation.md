## Prerequisites/References:

## Having almost the same height

![410avlTreeMerge.svg](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/410avlTreeMerge.svg)

## One tree has more height than the other

## ToDo

* Show why naive ways do not work - why it breaks the AVL Properties.
* Also add the case where Tree2 is larger than the Tree1.
