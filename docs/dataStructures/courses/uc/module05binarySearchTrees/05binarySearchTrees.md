## Introduction

![05binarySearchTreesBSTIntro.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/05binarySearchTreesBSTIntro.png)

* Left child < Parent < Right Child.
* Left child is less than the parent.
* Parent is less than the right child.

## Examples

![25bstExamples.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/25bstExamples.png)

* A and C are not proper binary search trees.
* In `C`, `4` is at the right subtree of the node `5`.
* But `4 < 5`. So, `4` should have been at the left subtree of the node `5`.
* B is a proper binary search tree.

### Why `BST`?

#### Post-sorted Operations

![15rangeSearchExample.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/15rangeSearchExample.png)

* **Any operation that works faster on a pre-sorted data.** 
* We might want to get the list of all the students with marks between **a particular range.**
* We might want to get the list of a few students with marks below and above **a particular range**. So, a list of students with marks **near the given range**.
* We might want to get the list of all the emails between **a particular date range**.
* We might want to return **all the words** from a dictionary that starts with the **first letter of a given string**.

#### Problems with the known data structures

##### Arrays

* An unsorted array would take `O(n)` time to find a range or neighbours.
* A sorted array would take `O(n)` time for `insert`, and `delete` operations.

##### Linked Lists

* An unsorted linked list would take `O(n)` time to find a range or neighbours.
* A sorted linked list would take `O(n)` time for the `insert` operation.
* We cannot perform the `Binary Search` on a linked list.
* Because a linked list is not a contiguous data structure.

##### Hash Table

* Look up is fine in a hash table. We can do it in `O(1)`.
* But comparing and searching for a particular range, or neighbour, is almost impractical. We have to compare each element with all the other elements.

#### Search

* A normal binary tree can take `O(n)` (linear time) for searching a node, because we have to check each node. Reference: [Trees](../module01BasicDataStructures/section03trees/trees.md).
* Whereas, a BST takes `O(Tree Height) = O(log n)` for searching.

![10bstFindIntro.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/12bstFindIntro.png)

* For example, in the given image, we want to find `6`.
* We may start with the root node: `3`.
* We compare `3` and `6`. 
* We find that `6 > 3`. 
* It means that `6` must be at the right side.
* So, we completely discard the left side of `3`.
* We check the right child of `3`.
* We find the right child of `3` is `5`.
* We compare `5` and `6`.
* We find that `6 > 5`.
* It means that `6` must be at the right side.
* So again, we completely discard the left side of `5`.
* We check the right child of `5`.
* We find the right child of `5` is `6`.

### `In-Order(Left-Parent-Right)` Traversal is sorted

![05binarySearchTreesBSTIntro.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/05binarySearchTreesBSTIntro.png)

* We may start the traversal with the root (parent) node `3`.
* The `In-order` traversal follows `Left-Parent-Right` order.
* So, we always prioritize and cover the `Left` children first.
* Then, we cover the `parents`.
* And in the end, we cover the `Right` children.
* The process looks like below:
---
> Start: Standing at a node. This is the current parent. 
> Cover the left child. Repeat from the start until there is no more left child.  
> Cover the node itself.  
> Cover the right child. Repeat from the start.  
---
* So, standing at `3`, we ask: Do we have a `left` child? 
* Yes, we have: `2`. It becomes the current parent.
* Again, standing at `2`, we ask: Do we have a `left` child?
* Yes, we have: `1`. It becomes the current parent.
* Again, standing at `1`, we ask: Do we have a `left` child?
* No. 
* So, we cover the current `parent`, that is `1`. 
```
1
```
* After covering the parent, we ask: Do we have a `right` child?
* No. 
* So, it is time to cover the `immediate parent` of the `current parent`.
* The immediate parent of the current parent `1` is `2`.
* Now, the the current parent is `2`.
* Did we cover the left child of the current parent? Yes.
* So, we cover the current parent, `2`.
```
1 --> 2
```
* After covering the parent, we ask: Do we have a `right` child?
* No. 
* So, it is time to cover the `immediate parent` of the `current parent`.
* The immediate parent of the current parent, `2` is `3`.
* Now, the current parent is `3`.
* So, we cover `3`.
```
1 --> 2 --> 3
```
* After covering the parent, we ask: Do we have a `right` child?
* Yes.
* The right child is `5`.
* So, it becomes the current parent.
* Standing at the parent, we ask: Do we have a `left` child?
* Yes.
* The left child is `4`.
* So, it becomes the current parent.
* Standing at the parent, we ask: Do we have a `left` child?
* No.
* So, we cover the current parent, `4`.
```
1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4
```
* After covering the parent, we ask: Do we have a `right` child?
* No.
* Cover the immediate parent, `5`.
```
1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5
```
* After covering the parent, we ask: Do we have a `right` child?
* Yes. 
* Go to the right child, `6`.
* Ask: Do we have a `left` child?
* No.
* Cover the current parent, `6`.
```
1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6
```
* After covering the parent, we ask: Do we have a `right` child?
* No.
* Done.

### Building a BST (Binary Search Tree)

* Let us say, we have an array: {3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4}.
* We want to build a binary search tree (BST) for it.
* We cover each element of the array, one by one, one at a time.
* We compare each element of the array with the BST using the `in-order` traversal.
* The first element is: `3`.
* The BST does not have any node yet. 
* There is no root node in the BST yet.
* So, in that case (a base case), the incoming element becomes the root.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: redux
  flowchart:
    curve: linear
---
flowchart TD
    A(("3"))
```
* Then, we get `2`.
* So, we compare it with the root: `3`.
* `3` > `2`. So, `2` goes to the left.
* There is no element to the left of the `3`.
* So, we set `2` to the left of `3`.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: redux
  flowchart:
    curve: linear
---
flowchart TD
    A(("3")) --> n1(("2")) & n2(("?"))
    style n2 stroke:none,fill:transparent
```

* Then, we get `1`.
* We start with the root, `3`. 
* We compare it with the root, `3`.
* `3` > `1`. So, `1` goes to the left of `3`.
* When we go to the left of `3`, we find `2`.
* So, we compare `1` with `2`.
* `2` > `1`. So, `1` goes to the left of `2`.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: redux
  flowchart:
    curve: linear
---
flowchart TD
    A(("3")) --> n1(("2")) & n2(("?"))
    n1 --> n3(("1")) & n4(("?"))
    style n2 stroke:none,fill:transparent
    style n4 stroke:none,fill:transparent
```

* Then, we get `5`.
* We compare it with the root, `3`.
* `3` < `5`. So, `5` goes to the right of `3`.
* When we go to the right of `3`, we don't find any node.
* So, we set `5` to the right of `3`.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: redux
  flowchart:
    curve: linear
---
flowchart TD
    A(("3")) --> n1(("2")) & n2(("5"))
    n1 --> n3(("1")) & n4(("?"))
    style n4 stroke:none,fill:transparent
```

* Then, we get `6`.
* We compare it with the root, `3`.
* `3` < `6`. So, we travel to the right of `3`.
* We get `5`. We compare it with `6`.
* `5` < `6`. So, `6` goes to the right of `5`.
* We travel to the right of `5`.
* We find nothing.
* So, we place `6` to the right of `5`.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: redux
  flowchart:
    curve: linear
---
flowchart TD
    A(("3")) --> n1(("2")) & n2(("5"))
    n1 --> n3(("1")) & n4(("?"))
    n2 --> n5(("?")) & n6(("6"))
    style n4 stroke:none,fill:transparent
    style n5 stroke:none,fill:transparent
```

* Then, we get `4`.
* We compare it with the root, `3`.
* `3` < `4`. So, we travel right to `3`.
* We get `5`. We compare it with `4`.
* `5` > `4`. So, we travel left to `5`.
* We find nothing.
* So, we place `4` to the left of `5`.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: redux
  flowchart:
    curve: linear
---
flowchart TD
    A(("3")) --> n1(("2")) & n2(("5"))
    n1 --> n3(("1")) & n4(("?"))
    n2 --> n5(("4")) & n6(("6"))
    style n4 stroke:none,fill:transparent
```

* We processed all the elements.

```mermaid

  theme: redux
  flowchart:
    curve: linear

    A(("3")) --> n1(("2")) & n2(("5"))
    n1 --> n3(("1"))
    n1 --- n4(("<br>"))
    n2 --> n5(("4")) & n6(("6"))
    style n4 stroke:none,fill:transparent
    linkStyle 3 stroke:none,fill:none
```
