## Understanding the basic runtime of a binary search tree operation

![90bstFindIntroRuntime.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/90bstFindIntroRuntime.png)

* The `find` operation depends on the `depth` of the tree.
* If a node has a higher depth, then we take more time.
* For example, while trying to find `6`.
* Similarly, if the node has a lower depth, we take less time.
* For example, `3`.
* If you remember, we have associated the well analogy with `depth` in [Trees](../module01BasicDataStructures/section03trees/trees.md).
* So, it is like a node that we want to find is in a well.
* It is looking upside waiting for someone to descend into the well.

## The depth problem

![120bstDepthProblemExample3.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/120bstDepthProblemExample3.png)

* If a binary search tree is not balanced, we might take `O(n)` time for the `find` operation. 

## How does the re-balancing solve the depth problem?

![130bstBalancingExample.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/130bstBalancingExample.png)

* Re-balancing reduces the depth and keeps the `in-order (LPR)` sorted.
* Hence, the `find` operation becomes faster (efficient).
* The key observation here is that the efficiency depends on the height of the tree.
* And the height of a tree depends on the height of subtrees.
* So, if we maintain the height of subtrees, we can maintain the height of the tree.
* If the distribution (structure) of the subtrees is unbalanced, then the tree becomes taller, unbalanced and inefficient.
* So, if we control and maintain the distribution (structure) of the subtree, we can control the efficiency of the tree.
* To control and maintain the distribution (structure) of a subtree, we need a way to define, and measure it.
* We already know that "height" is the defining property.
* And the measurement scale here is in terms of "balance."
* "Balance" is associated with the "height" only.
* So, "maintaining the balance" means "maintaining the height".
* And, a tree can be highly "unbalanced," "balanced," or somewhere in the middle.
* It means that the tree can be "taller," "shorter," or somewhere in the middle.
* Also, we need to ensure that the efforts of maintaining the balance should not defeat the core purpose.
* The core purpose is to make various operations, such as `find(search)` (that depends on the tree height) more efficient.

## What can create an unbalanced tree?

![140bstInsertDeleteProblem.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/140bstInsertDeleteProblem.png)

* Insert and delete operations.

## How do we keep the binary search tree balanced?

* Using the rotation technique.

## Rotation of a binary search tree

* It is possible to change the structure of a binary search tree without violating the rules that define the binary search tree.
* For example, as shown in the image below: 

![150bstRotation.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/150bstRotation.png)

## Balancing Thought Process

* To maintain the balance of a binary search tree, we need to define, measure, and keep track of the "balance".
* We use the term "height" to define, measure, and keep track of the "balance."

## Height of a node

![160nodeHeight.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/160nodeHeight.png)

![170nodeHeight2.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/170nodeHeight2.png)

* The longest path from the node to the leaf

```kotlin

val heightOfNode = 1 + maxOf(Node.left.height, Node.right.height) 

```

## A balanced binary search tree

![190balancedBst.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/190balancedBst.png)

* If the height of a left sub-tree is equal to the height of a right sub-tree, we call it a perfectly balanced tree.
* It means that, we need to add another field, "height" to the node structure.
* So that we can measure and keep track of the "balance".
* And when a tree is balanced:


$$
N.left.height == N.right.height
$$
$$
N.left.height - N.right.height = 0
$$

* However, maintaining a perfectly balanced binary search tree after every `insert` and `delete` operation might take `O(n)` time.
* The objective of maintaining the "balance" is to maintain the "height".
* If we maintain the "height" at most `O(log n)`, then we can perform various operations, such as `find(search)` efficiently.
* But if maintaining the perfect balance itself takes `O(n)` time, then it is not helpful.
* So, we take some flexibility here.
* In an AVL tree, we maintain the below property: 

$$
N.left.height - N.right.height <= 1
$$

* It is known as the "controlled balance."
* And the analysis of such an AVL-Tree, satisfies the below formula:

$$
N(h) = 1 + N(h - 1) + N(h - 2)
$$

* Here, `N(h)` means "minimum number of nodes for an AVL-Tree of height `h`."
* The formula connects (associates) the "minimum number of nodes" with the "height".
* And we will see that using the "rotation" technique, we can maintain this "flexible balance" (also known as: "enough balance," "perfectly imperfect balance," etc.) in just `O(1)` time!
* It means that we don't spend more time in maintaining the balance, and we can still maintain the tree height at most `O(log n)`.
* Now, to maintain the "balance," we need to maintain the "height".
* And to maintain the "height," we need to track it.
* To track "height," we introduce a new field (property) to the "node".

## A node structure for balance

![180bstAvlNodeStructure.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/180bstAvlNodeStructure.png)

## AVL Claim: AVL Properties

* We claim that the height of a balanced binary tree (AVL) is at most $O(log\ n)$.
* Now, height is made up with nodes.
* So, it is possible to get an idea about the total number of nodes based upon the height of the tree.
* And we can add (consider) the "balance" property into this relationship.
* So, we are trying to figure out the relationship between the height and the total number of nodes in a tree when the tree is balanced.
* So, we start with the minimum nodes.
* We want to figure out the minimum nodes for a binary tree of height `h`.
* As per the AVL property, the difference between the height of two children should be less than or equal to 1.
* We can have such an AVL tree as shown in the below image:

![200heightAndNodesRelation.png](../../../../../assets/images/dataStructures/uc/module05binarySearchTreesBST/200heightAndNodesRelation.png)

* Now, the subtree of height `h - 1` must have at least `h - 1` nodes.
* Let us denote it as `N(h - 1)` that says the minimum nodes in a tree of height `h - 1`.
* And the subtree of height `h - 2` must have at least `h - 2` nodes.
* So, `N(h - 2)` says the minimum nodes in a tree of height `h - 2`.
* Now, if we add `+1(the root node)` to `N(h - 1) + N(h - 2)`, we get the minimum nodes in a tree of height `h`.
* So, it is:

$$
N(h) = 1 + N(h - 1) + N(h - 2)
$$

* On the other hand, for a Fibonacci number $F_h$, we can say:

$$
F_h = F_{h - 1} + F_{h - 2}
$$

* The value of a Fibonacci number, $F_h$ is a summation of the previous (last) Fibonacci number, $F_{h - 1}$ and the second previous (second last) Fibonacci number, $F_{h - 2}$.
* And since $N(h)$ represents "minimum number of nodes for an AVL-Tree of height `h`," we can say:

$$
N(h) >= F_h
$$

* If we represent this "minimum number of nodes" as `n`, then it is:

$$
n >= F_h
$$

* Also:

$$
F_h >= 2^{\frac{h}{2}}
$$

* So, it becomes:

$$
n >= 2^{\frac{h}{2}}
$$

* Taking $log_2$ both the sides:

$$
log_2(n) >= log_2(2^{\frac{h}{2}})
$$

$$
log_2(n) >= \frac{h}{2}
$$

* Multiplying both the sides by 2:

$$
2log_2(n) >= h
$$

$$
h <= 2log_2(n)
$$

* Dropping the constant `2`,

$$
h <= log_2(n)
$$

* We just proved that the maximum height of an AVL-Tree is $log_2(n)$.

## Summary: TL;DR

* A binary search tree (BST) becomes inefficient as we perform the insert or delete operations.
* Insert or delete operations can skew the BST and make it taller and thin. 
* As a result, various operations such as `find(search)` become inefficient.
* The efficiency depends on the tree height.
* Tree height depends on the height of the subtrees.
* If we can control the height of the subtrees, we can maintain the height and efficiency of the tree.
* However, the efforts of controlling the height of the subtrees should not defeat the core purpose.
* The core purpose is to perform various operations such as `find(search)` efficiently.
* It turned out that, if we can control $N.left.height - N.right.height <= 1$, we get a nice enough balance.
* It is known as the "Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL)" property. 
* The minimum number of nodes for an AVL-Tree of height, `h` is:

$$
N(h) = 1 + N(h - 1) + N(h - 2)
$$

* We can relate it with a Fibonacci number, $F_h$.

$$
F_h >= 2^{\frac{h}{2}}
$$

$$
n >= 2^{\frac{h}{2}}
$$

$$
log_2(n) >= h
$$

$$
h <= log_2(n)
$$

* It means that the maximum height of an AVL-Tree is $log(n)$. 
* Next, we will see how to maintain the AVL-Tree property through the "rotation" technique.
