2. A sentence can be represented in the form of a grammar structure.
3. Our sentence has two main parts: Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase.
4. The Noun Phrase has a child, "I".
5. The Verb Phrase has two main parts: Verb and Noun Phrase.
6. The Verb is: ate
7. And the Noun Phrase has two main parts: Determiner and Noun.
8. The determiner has one child: the
9. The noun has one child: plum
10. So, we represented a structure of a sentence using a tree.
11. Hence, we can use a tree to represent a structure.
