* Sorting and UI: Handle sorting and UI interactions in the browser.
* Loading and Messages: Use the browser script to manage loading states and display messages.

 * The expression (async () => { ... })() is an Immediately Invoked Async Function Expression (IIAFE).
 * The keyword async indicates that the function is asynchronous.
 * Asynchronous functions return a Promise and allow you to
 * use the await keyword inside them to pause execution until a Promise is resolved or rejected.
 * The parentheses around async () => { ... } create a function expression.
 * This function is called immediately after being defined, hence the term Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).
 * This allows you to execute asynchronous code immediately without explicitly naming the function or invoking it separately.
 * Anonymous Arrow Function `() => {}`` is a syntax, that defines a function using the arrow function syntax,
 * which is a more concise way of writing functions in JavaScript.
 * The IIFE pattern is used to create a scope for the variables declared inside the function.
 * This prevents polluting the global scope.
 * By using async, you can use await inside the function to handle Promises in a cleaner,
 * more readable manner compared to chaining .then() calls.
 * The IIFE is useful for one-time operations where you donâ€™t need to reuse the function.
