/**
 * When we implement a stack using an array, we need to define the fixed size.
 *
 * @param capacity We use the term `capacity` instead of `size` because `size` might be interpreted as the
 *                 `current size.` However, when we implement `stack,` using an `array,` we have to specify the `size.`
 *                 But, the stack does not have to be filled up to the `size.` It is just a `capacity` up to which we
 *                 can fill the `stack.`
 *                 The term `capacity` naturally expresses that the `stack` has certain `capacity`.
 *                 It implicitly says that this is not the current size of the stack.
 *                 The current size of the stack might be full, empty, half, or somewhere in between of its `capacity.`

     * ---------------------------------------------------------
     * In Kotlin (and Java), generics are implemented using type erasure.
     * This means that the type parameter `T` is not retained at runtime; it's only available at compile time.
     * `Arrays`, however, are reifiedâ€”they require their element type to be known at runtime for type safety.
     * Since the JVM doesn't know what `T` is at runtime, it cannot allocate an array of T.
     * Attempting to do so, results in a runtime error.
     *
     * To work around this, we use `Array<Any?>`, which can hold any type,
     * and then cast elements back to `T` when retrieving them.
     *
     * This is a well-known workaround for implementing generic collections with arrays on the JVM.
     * ---------------------------------------------------------
     * We cannot have ```Array<T>``` because of type erasure.
     * Type erasure means that the type "T" information is not available at runtime,
     * because the generic type parameters are erased at runtime.
     *
     * So, at compile time (while we write the code), the IDE (compiler) may not give any error.
     * But, an `Array` needs a reified type that it can recognize at runtime.
     * So, when we run the code, we might get some error.
     * ```
     * Kotlin: Cannot use 'T' as reified type parameter. Use a class instead.
     * ```
     * It means that at runtime when `Array` tries to use the generic type parameter `T` (reified),
     * there is no information. Because, the generic type parameters are erased at runtime.
     * And an `Array` needs to know its element type `T` at runtime because of type safety.
     *
     * So, we have to use "Any," which is the super type of all the types in Kotlin.
     * (Similar to `Object` in Java.).
