/**
 * # Problem Statement: Check brackets in the code
 *
 * ## Problem Introduction:
 *
 * * In this problem you will implement a feature for a text editor to find errors in the usage of brackets in the
 * code.
 *
 * ## Problem Description:
 *
 * **Task.**
 *
 * * Your friend is making a text editor for programmers.
 * * He is currently working on a feature that will find errors in the usage of different types of brackets.
 * * Code can contain any brackets from the set `[]{}()`, where the opening brackets are `[`,`{`, and `(` and
 * the closing brackets corresponding to them are `]`,`}`, and `)`.
 * * For convenience, the text editor should not only inform the user that there is an error in the usage
 * of brackets, but also point to the exact place in the code with the problematic bracket.
 *
 * * First priority is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesn‚Äôt have an opening bracket before
 * it, like `]` in `]()`, or closes the wrong opening bracket, like `}` in `()[}`.
 * * If there are no such mistakes, then it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the corresponding
 * closing bracket after it, like `(` in `{}([]`.
 * * If there are no mistakes, text editor should inform the user that the usage of brackets is correct.
 * * Apart from the brackets, code can contain big and small latin letters, digits and punctuation marks.
 * * More formally, all brackets in the code should be divided into pairs of matching brackets, such that in
 * each pair the opening bracket goes before the closing bracket, and for any two pairs of brackets either
 * one of them is nested inside another one as in `(foo[bar])` or they are separate as in `f(a,b)-g[c]`.
 * * The bracket `[` corresponds to the bracket `]`, `{` corresponds to `}`, and `(` corresponds to `)`.
 *
 * **Input Format**
 *
 * * Input contains one string `ùëÜ` which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation
 * marks and brackets from the set `[]{}()`.
 *
 * **Constraints**
 *
 * * The length of `ùëÜ` is at least `1` and at most `10^5`.
 *
 * **Output Format**
 *
 * * If the code in `ùëÜ` uses brackets correctly, output, `Success` (without the quotes).
 * * Otherwise, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing
 * brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.
 *
 * **Sample 1.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * []
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * Success
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * The brackets are used correctly: there is just one pair of brackets `[` and `]`, they correspond to each
 * other, the left bracket `[` goes before the right bracket `]`, and no two pairs of brackets intersect, because
 * there is just one pair of brackets.
 *
 * **Sample 2.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * {}[]
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * Success
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * The brackets are used correctly: there are two pairs of brackets ‚Äî the first pair of `{` and `}`, and second pair
 * of `[` and `]` ‚Äî and these pairs do not intersect.
 *
 * **Sample 3.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * [()]
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * Success
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * The brackets are used correctly: there are two pairs of brackets ‚Äî the first pair of `[` and `]`, and second pair
 * of `(` and `)` ‚Äî and the second pair is nested inside the first pair.
 *
 * **Sample 4.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * (())
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * Success
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * Pairs with the same types of brackets can also be nested.
 *
 * **Sample 5.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * {[]}()
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * Success
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * Here there are 3 pairs of brackets, one of them is nested into another one, and the third one is separate
 * from the first two.
 *
 * **Sample 6.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * {
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * 1
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * The code `{` doesn‚Äôt use brackets correctly, because brackets cannot be divided into pairs (there is just
 * one bracket). There are no closing brackets, and the first unmatched opening bracket is `{`, and its
 * position is 1, so we output 1.
 *
 * **Sample 7.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * {[}
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * 3
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * The bracket `}` is unmatched, because the last unmatched opening bracket before it is `[` and not `{`.
 * * It is the first unmatched closing bracket, and our first priority is to output the first unmatched closing
 * bracket, and its position is 3, so we output 3.
 *
 * **Sample 8.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * foo(bar);
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * Success
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * All the brackets are matching, and all the other symbols can be ignored.
 *
 * **Sample 9.**
 *
 * * Input:
 * ```
 * foo(bar[i);
 * ```
 * * Output:
 * ```
 * 10
 * ```
 * **Explanation:**
 *
 * * `)` doesn‚Äôt match `[`, so `)` is the first unmatched closing bracket, so we output its position, which is 10.
